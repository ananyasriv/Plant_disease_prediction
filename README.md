Plants are constantly exposure to pathogens such as virus, bacteria and fungi. Plant diseases caused by pathogens lead significant crop yield loss globally. Numerous researchers have been studying how to reduce the damage of plant diseases. Some researchers investigated the resistance genes in plants and attempt to enhance plantsâ€™ resistance against pathogens. Meanwhile, some other researchers developed identification and scoring system to monitor and predict plant di-seases based on leaves images. The purpose of this review is to present the application of machine learning in plant resistance genes discovery and plant diseases classification.

I have used Inception v3 model which is an image recognition model that has been show to attain greater accuracy. It uses transfer learning which is machine learning problem that focuses on storing knowledge gained by whi;e solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem.
